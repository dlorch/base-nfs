[![pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/dlorch/base-nfs/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/dlorch/base-nfs/commits/master)

A fully functional NFS (Network File System) Version 3 server
running an in-memory file system. Includes auxiliary services
like portmap and mount.

## Development

Following `make` targets are available. For some targets, [Docker]
and [Docker Compose] are necessary.

```
$ make
integration-logs               show logs from nfs-server [requires Docker Compose]
integration-setup              build docker images for integration tests [requires Docker Compose]
integration-shell              enter shell on tester [requires Docker Compose]
integration-teardown           destroy resources associated to integration tests [requires Docker Compose]
integration                    run all integration tests [requires Docker Compose]
unittests                      run all unit tests
```

### General Tips for Debugging

Retrieve logs from NFS server:

```
$ make integration-logs
```

Enter a shell. The NFS server is available as `nfs-server`:

```
$ make integration-shell
# showmount -e nfs-server  # inside the shell
```

Cleanup (removes containers and logs):

```
$ make integration-teardown
```

### Tips for Debugging Protocol Problems

Enter a shell and use `tcpdump` to record traffic, which can later
be analyzed using [Wireshark].

```
$ make integration-shell
#Â tpcdump -i eth0 -w /tests/dump.pcap &  # run in background
```

This will capture the network traffic to the NFS server. The
directory `/tests/` is mounted to the host system. Now run your
commands:

```
# showmount -e nfs-server
```

Get `tcpdump` back in the foreground, and close it with CTRL-C:

```
# fg
^C
```

You can now analyze `test/dump.pcap` with [Wireshark].
